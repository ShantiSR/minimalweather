      <h1>What's so special with Minimal Weather now?</h1>
      <img src="/assets/img/showcase.png" alt="Minimal Weather">
      <p>
        Minimal Weather does a cool trick. Which is update the app icon
        when you check the weather. That's a good thing to easily
        remember how you should go out.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the new tricks that it has now it's that it'll show you
        an umbrella if there's a chance of rain in the next 8 hours. So
        then you can be aware of it before going to work.
      </p>

      <h2>The technology behind it:</h2>
      <h3>The icon update</h3>
      <img src="/assets/img/icon.png" alt="icon">
      <p>The concept it's pretty easy actually. Apple provides a link rel='apple-touch-icon', their version of a favicon.</p>

      <p>That's the special icon that the iOS device uses in the home screen.</p>

      <p>I've started some experiments and then realizing two things:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>The icon gets read every time the app gets loaded and probably checked against any old version.</li>
        <li>MobileSafari supports data-url content.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Then I started this idea with some goals, do not use any images, as simple as possible and as little backend as possible.</p>

      <h4>The truth behind the idea</h4>

      <p>Initially I started with a pure HTML5 + javascript implementation. Using browser geolocation and canvas + a really pretty typography.</p>

      <h5>The problems</h5>

      <p>But things didn't worked as well as I was expecting. The geolocation being asynchronous proved to be a too slow information source to render the icon and let the device store the icon I was generating.</p>

      <p>Also using the typography in the canvas element wasn't reliable enough, some times the generated canvas didn't include the weather icons because the loading + rendering time.</p>

      <h3>Language</h3>
      <img src="/assets/img/golang.png" alt="Go">
      <p>
        Weapon of choice:
        <a href="http://golang.org">Go</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        The backend of the application is written in Go. I choose Go for several
        reasons:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>I wanted to use Go in a real world problem</li>
        <li>
          The concurrency primitives are really useful when interacting with
          several APIs
        </li>
        <li>The overall performance is quite better than the Ruby version</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Geolocation</h3>
      <img src="/assets/img/maxmind.png" alt="Go">
      <p>
        Weapon of choice:
        <a href="http://maxmind.com">Maxmind</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you take a look to the code you'll realize that there's an IP
        geolocation but when you use the app it asks you about allowing HTML5
        Geolocation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reason behind it is simple: The first time you use the app it will
        use your IP address and save the result in a cookie, then the
        geolocation starts and if for some reason the geolocation and the ip
        cities are different it will refresh the cookie with the new value. That
        way I'll save some requests to the IP geolocation service.
      </p>
      <h3>Javascript</h3>
      <img src="/assets/img/javascript.png" alt="Javascript">
      <p>
        Weapon of choice:
        <a href="http://vanilla-js.com/">Vanilla Javascript</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I know that there are amazing libs out there and I really tried to apply
        them to Minimal Weather but I found a huge overhead in development and
        in the final product so I'm using vanilla JS. The only place where a lib
        is used is to do a geolocation check and I choose zepto for this.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keeping things simple is what allows this app to exists. A quick
        execution helps the canvas to be generated. Few overhead makes this
        developer happy.
      </p>
      <h3>Database</h3>
      <img src="/assets/img/redis.png" alt="Redis">
      <p>
        Weapon of choice:
        <a href="http://openredis.com">OpenRedis</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        The database that uses Minimal Weather is Redis thanks to the
        OpenRedis guys.

        There are a few reasons on why to use Redis. One of those
        reasons is because I really like it but besides that the key
        expiration helped me a lot to handle the weather, ip and
        location caches.
      </p>
      <h3>Thanks to:</h3>
      <p>
        I can only make this projects thanks to friends that hunt bugs and give
        me amazing feedback. Love you guys.
